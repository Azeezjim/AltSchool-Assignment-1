      Garuba Abdul Azeez is a Front-end web developer with a great sense of
      innovation and creativity to come up with problem solving, responsive web
      applications. I am driven by the passion to detect warring conditions,
      through carefully deduced observations and putting forward collaborative
      efforts to technically solve these problems while strongly considering
      vastly favourable use experience. While currently in my final year of
      tertiary studies as a Computer Scientist it has always been my desire to
      put my expertise to practice leaving a mark in our rapidly digitalizing
      world. My voyage of becoming a frontend developer has seen me gain a
      credible amount of experience on Javascript, ReactJs and NextJs. An
      engrossing journey that began in the final third of 2020 has never come to
      a halt. A cruise that has inspired my current position as a web developer
      and fueled my ever-increasing desire to improve myself.
